                    internal
                    privacy practices and as disclosed on our employee handbook. Andela does not, however, buy or sell
                    PII
                    for business practices or purposes. Andela may transfer data due to an acquisition of business
                    assets by
                    another entity, in the ordinary course of business due to expansions or fund-raising, or as

                    transfer of your PII information.

                    All transfers of such information will be: (1) limited data for specific purposes; (2) based on
                    proper
                    determination that: (i) the recipient shall adhere to Privacy Shield principles; (ii) notify Andela
                    if
                    they determine at any subsequent they will not adhere to such principles; and (iii) to stop and
                    remediate any unauthorized processing; and (3) based on contractually established privacy terms with
                    the
                    recipient of such information that can be either: (i) shared with you; or (ii) reasonably summarized
                    for
                    you.

                    Andela is responsible and liable for the processing of PII it receives and transfers to a third
                    party
                    acting on Andela’s behalf. Andela complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward

                    of PII from the EU including liability provisions of such onward transfer.
